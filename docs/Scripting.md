Scripting is essential for the applications you make in Acrylic. Scripting is how you can make the player respond to input from the user and program events and behaviours that are required for gameplay.

While the [Scripting API](/ScriptingAPI/About.md) is currently basic in Acrylic, eventually you'll be able to to alot more things with it.
